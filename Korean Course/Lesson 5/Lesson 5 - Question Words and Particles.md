# Lesson 5: Question Words and Particles

Greetings, agent. Your mission today involves mastering question words and understanding basic particles in Korean. These skills are essential for gathering intelligence and navigating complex situations in the field.

## Question Words

1. 누구 (nugu) - Who
2. 무엇/뭐 (mueot/mwo) - What
3. 어디 (eodi) - Where
4. 언제 (eonje) - When
5. 왜 (wae) - Why
6. 어떻게 (eotteoke) - How

## Basic Particles

Particles are crucial in Korean as they define the role of words in a sentence.

1. 은/는 (eun/neun) - Topic marker
2. 이/가 (i/ga) - Subject marker
3. 을/를 (eul/reul) - Object marker
4. 에 (e) - In/at/to (location)
5. 에서 (eseo) - From/at (location for actions)
6. 로/으로 (ro/euro) - To/towards/by (direction or means)

## Forming Questions

To form a question, simply add the question word and end the sentence with 요 (yo) for polite speech.

Examples:
1. 누가 왔어요? (nuga wasseoyo?) - Who came?
2. 어디에 갔어요? (eodie gasseoyo?) - Where did (you) go?
3. 왜 여기 있어요? (wae yeogi isseoyo?) - Why are (you) here?

## Spy-themed Practice

1. 누가 비밀 정보를 가지고 있어요? (nuga bimil jeongboreul gajigo isseoyo?) - Who has the secret information?
2. 임무는 어떻게 수행할 거예요? (immuneun eotteoke suhaenghal geoyeyo?) - How will (you) carry out the mission?
3. 적은 어디에서 왔어요? (jeogeun eodieseo wasseoyo?) - Where did the enemy come from?

## Homework

1. Create questions using each of the question words in a spy context.
2. Practice using particles by describing objects and people in your room.
3. Watch a scene from "The Spy Gone North" and try to identify question words and particles.

Remember, agent, asking the right questions and understanding the structure of sentences is key to successful intelligence gathering. Keep honing your skills!
