# Lesson 1: Introduction to Hangul (한글)

Welcome to your Korean language adventure! As a spy-in-training, your first mission is to decode the Korean writing system. This will be crucial for reading secret messages and understanding local intel.

## The Basics of Hangul

Hangul is the Korean alphabet, consisting of 14 consonants and 10 vowels. Unlike many writing systems, Hangul is organized into blocks that form syllables.

### Consonants (자음)
Let's start with five basic consonants:

1. ㄱ (g/k) - Think of it as a gun's trigger
2. ㄴ (n) - Imagine a nose in profile
3. ㄷ (d/t) - Picture a doorknob
4. ㄹ (r/l) - Visualize a radio antenna
5. ㅁ (m) - See it as a message box

### Vowels (모음)
Now, let's learn five basic vowels:

1. ㅏ (a) - Like an arrow pointing right
2. ㅓ (eo) - An arrow pointing left
3. ㅗ (o) - A horizontal line over a dot
4. ㅜ (u) - A horizontal line under a dot
5. ㅡ (eu) - A simple horizontal line

## Forming Syllables

In Korean, syllables are formed by combining consonants and vowels. The basic structure is:

Initial Consonant + Vowel + (Optional) Final Consonant

For example:
- 가 (ga) = ㄱ + ㅏ
- 남 (nam) = ㄴ + ㅏ + ㅁ

## Practice

Try to decode these Korean spy codenames:
1. 강 (gang)
2. 문 (mun)
3. 김 (kim)

Remember, mastering Hangul is your first step to becoming a top agent in Korea. In the next lesson, we'll learn some basic greetings to help you blend in with the locals.

## Homework

1. Practice writing the consonants and vowels we learned today.
2. Try to form at least 10 syllables using the letters you've learned.
3. Watch the opening credits of "Iris" or "The K2" and see if you can spot any of the letters we've learned.

Good luck, agent! Your Korean language mission has just begun.
